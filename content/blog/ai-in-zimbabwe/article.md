Just as in any another country, in Zimbabwe AI is mostly used by developers. AI though overhyped and burning millions over night has changed many lives for better and for worse. What is AI anyways? A question that we might take lightly but some people still have no idea what AI is in 2026.

## What is AI

Our answer: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a term used to describe systems mostly presented to us as websites and mobile applications that make use of data ingested into their memory to simulate human intelligence and perform similar tasks.

Actual Definition: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. [wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI)%20is%20the%20capability%20of%20computational%20systems%20to%20perform%20tasks%20typically%20associated%20with%20human%20intelligence%2C%20such%20as%20learning%2C%20reasoning%2C%20problem%2Dsolving%2C%20perception%2C%20and%20decision%2Dmaking.>)

So that is AI in a nutshell. We are not going to get too deep into the technical details in this article. There are other words you might come across like llm (language learning model). LLM generally refers to a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## Most used AI tools in Zimbabwe

1. **chatgpt.com:** a chat based language learning model (llm) by OpenAI

## What you can do with AI

There are so many AI tools and the big ones have a lot of models to choose from. Try to chase AI trends and you will never see the end of that line as every week there is another "mind blowing" AI thing. Anyways let's jump into AI use-cases.

- **Question and Answer Chatting**: you can use tools like chatgpt and meta ai for asking general questions.
- **Solving math/coding problems**: you can use tools like claude, gemini (which also fits in other categories) to solve complex problems.
- **Media generation**: you can use tools like midjourney, elevenlabs to generate images, videos and even music.
- **automation**: you can use tools like zapier, n8n to simplify your workflows by making ai do repetitive little tasks for you like sorting emails.
